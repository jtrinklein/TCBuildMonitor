TCBuildMonitor

This is a simple server that recieves POST requests from TeamCity WebHooks.

The server listens for POSTs to /buildchanges on build changes and fires a sound when builds turn red, using a locally installed NSoundSys server.

The previous build status can be viewed by performing a GET on /lastbuild
